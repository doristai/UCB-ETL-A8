# UCB-ETL-A8

## Overview

The goal of this project was to collect movie data from both wikipedia and kaggle and create a database that students can use to preform their own analysis. To achieve this, first, extracted the essential data from Wikipedia and Kaggle, used pandas library in Python to transform the data into a working dataframe, and then loaded it to PostgreSQL for students to use it.
